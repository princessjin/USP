Tutorial 4 - Grep & RegEx 

Using grep command
Syntax:

grep [option] [pattern] [file name]

To search for a string pattern in a file:

grep ‘string’ [filename]  

Example:    grep ‘start’ stopwatch.sh

To search for the exact word match in a file:

grep -w ‘word’ [filename]

Example: grep -w ‘start’ stopwatch.sh




To ignore case for a search pattern in a file:

grep -i ‘pattern’ [filename]  

Example:    grep -i ‘row’ box.sh

To search for a variable value match in a file:

$var = ‘word’
grep  $var [filename]






To inverse the search and get all none-matching lines

grep -v ‘string’ [filename]  

Example:    grep -v ‘start’ stopwatch.sh

To get the count of matching line containing a pattern

grep -c ‘word’ [filename]

Example: grep -c ‘start’ stopwatch.sh




To display the line numbers as well as matching pattern:

grep -n ‘word’ [filename]

Example: grep -n ‘start’ stopwatch.sh




To print 2 lines before the matching pattern line:

grep -B 2 ‘string’ [filename]  

Example:    grep -B 2 ‘start’ stopwatch.sh

To print 2 lines after the matching pattern line:

grep -A 2 ‘word’ [filename]

Example: grep -A 2 ‘start’ stopwatch.sh




To print one line before and one line after the matching line:

grep -C 1 ‘string’ [filename]  

Example:    grep -C 1 ‘start’ stopwatch.sh

To recursively search for a pattern (i.e. home directory)

grep -r ‘word’ ~/

Example: grep -r ‘start’ ~/




To search for a string pattern and list all matching files:

grep -l ‘string’ /directory  

Example:    grep -l ‘row’ ~/

To display all matching files and numbered matching lines:
grep -rn ‘word’ /directory

Example: grep -rn ‘start’ ~/




To display matching lines numbers of certain file type:

grep -rn ‘string’ *.extension

Example:    grep -rn ‘start’ *.sh

To search for the matching complex RegEx in a file:

grep -E ‘EXP’ [filename] or use egrep






Examples: grep -E   ; egrep ; RegEx

grep -E ‘@whois\..{4}\..+;;$’ whois.sh


grep ‘\$[12]’ grameoflife.sh                     [OR Operation]

grep -E ‘[0-9]|$echo’ randomcard.sh      [OR Operation]

grep ‘\$’ towers.sh | grep ‘#’                    [AND Operation]

grep -E ‘#.*:’                                               [AND Operation]




Examples: grep -E   ; egrep ; RegEx

grep ‘^$’ [filename]          [Finds empty lines]

grep ‘^.$’ [filename]         [lines with exactly one character]

grep ‘\(\)’ [filename]        [Finds () pattern in a file]                                

grep ‘[A-Z]’ [filename]      [Finds word with uppercase]

grep ‘\$’     [filename]       [Finds lines with $]
